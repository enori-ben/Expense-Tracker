## Installation & Setup üöÄ

To get Expense Tracker running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
*   Android Studio Ladybug Feature Drop (2025.04.01) or later.
*   Android SDK 33+ installed.
*   A Firebase project setup (you already have `expense-tracker-b84b3`!).
*   Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password and Google providers) and **Cloud Firestore** in your Firebase project.
*   Obtain a Google Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio ([aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)). You'll need to update the `BuildConfig.kt` file with this key.

### Firebase Setup (Quick Check)
Based on the information you provided, your Firebase project `expense-tracker-b84b3` already has:
*   Firestore configured in `nam5`.
*   Authentication enabled with Email/Password and Google providers.
*   Security Rules for Firestore are defined for user management, transactions, categories, etc.

You just need to make sure the Android app is connected to this project (usually done by adding the `google-services.json` file to the `app` module).

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/enori-ben/Expense-Tracker.git
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio**
    *   Select "Open an Existing Project"
    *   Navigate to and select the cloned `Expense-Tracker` directory.
3.  **Add Google Services File:**
    *   In the Firebase console for `expense-tracker-b84b3`, add an Android app.
    *   Follow the steps to register your app using the package name `com.example.expensetracker`.
    *   Download the `google-services.json` file.
    *   Place the `google-services.json` file in your Android project's `app/` directory.
4.  **Add Google Gemini API Key:**
    *   Open the `BuildConfig.kt` file (usually located in the root of your `app` module's source sets, e.g., `app/src/main/java/com/example/expensetracker/BuildConfig.kt`).
    *   Replace `"AIzaSyB04Rd-g4N0Cio9NX1ok9w0j9QjL_6mMgc"` with your actual Gemini API Key. **Do NOT commit your API key directly to public repositories!** Consider using environment variables or build configurations for sensitive keys.
5.  **Build and Run**
    *   Sync your project with Gradle files (File > Sync Project with Gradle Files).
    *   Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run button in Android Studio.
    *   Choose a connected Android device or emulator (API 33+ recommended).
